Hi! Welcome to my rock paper scissors game! This will be basic but I would still like it
to look somewhat decent. The goal is to have 3 interactive buttons that will play against the computer and have the computer select something five times until someone wins the round.

I am hoping to add to this in the future, as practice for myself but also to show future devs and
employers what I can do. I hope you enjoy the way I created this.
